This script is meant to be run like
    ./create_US_demand_file.py Rochester.json

If you're downloading a pre-compiled release, then it might look something like
    ./create_US_demand_file.bin Rochester.json

You must provide an input JSON file.  Below are all available parameters for this input file.
Some parameters are optional: point_locs_to_move/moved_point_locs, universities + related parameters, and entertainment + related parameters.
If omitted, they will be ignored.
All other parameters are required.
See the examples/ directory for example JSON input files used for the maps shared on the Discord.

    city : string, the city you're modeling.  
           Example: "Rochester"
    airport : list of strings, IATA codes for the local airport 
                               Note: The first listed airport is used here to uniquely identify a city.  
              Example: ["ROC"]
    states : string or list of strings, two-letter code for the state(s) your map covers.  
            Example: "ny"
            Example: ["md", "dc", "va"]
    year : int, the year you want to use for the LODES data.  At the time of writing, it must be within 2002-2023.  
           Example: 2022
    bbox : list of ints, the [min_lon, min_lat, max_lon, max_lat] boundary for the city.  
           Example: [-77.8216, 43.0089, -77.399, 43.3117],
    cbd_bbox : list of ints, exactly like `bbox` except for the Central Business District.  
                             Can be used to reduce clustering for the downtown area.  
                             To disable, set this to null.
               Example: null

    HUMAN_READABLE : (optional) bool, determines whether to make the output demand_data.json file have indentation 
                                      structure for readability (true) or not to minimize file size (false).
                      Default: false
    MAXPOPSIZE : int, maximum size any pop can be.  
                      Pops larger than this value are split into multiple pops to follow this setting.
                 Example: 200
    CALCULATE_ROUTES : bool, determines whether to calculate commuting routes.  
                             Recommended to set this to false when initially testing out boundaries and clustering.
                       Example: true
    SMALL_THRESHOLD : int, maximum pop size considered for agglomerative clustering.  
                           Pops smaller than this size will be merged with other nearby pops that work at the same location.
                      Example: 100
    DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_NONCBD : float, distance threshold in degrees to consider when clustering.
                                       This is applied outside the CBD, or if the CBD is not used, then applied everywhere.
                                       Note that you will get demand points separated by less than this value, so do not 
                                       use this value as a "minimum separation" parameter.
                                Example: 0.1
    DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_CBD : float, like `DISTANCE_THRESHOLD_NONCBD` but applied within the CBD defined by `cbd_bbox`.
                             Example: 0.05
    DEMAND_FACTOR: float, multiply all LODES pop sizes by this factor.
                          Example: 2
    
    point_locs_to_move : list of list of floats, coordinates in [lon, lat] of demand points that you want to move 
                                                 for whatever reason.  
                                                 Must correspond exactly to the order used in `moved_point_locs`.
                                                 To not use this, set it to []
                         Example: [[-77.69260, 43.29925], [-77.69280, 43.28780], [-77.74163, 43.30533], 
                                   [-77.76616, 43.29830], [-77.75377, 43.29501], [-77.73190, 43.29221],

                                                    to reside.  One pop will be placed at the demand bubble closest to 
                                                    each specified coordinate.
                                                    If you don't care to set this, then use [] for each airport (e.g., 
                                                    use [[], []] for 2 airports) and the code will decide automatically.
                            Example: [[[-77.61298,  43.15729], [-77.60688,  43.15614], [-77.58936,  43.1547 ],
